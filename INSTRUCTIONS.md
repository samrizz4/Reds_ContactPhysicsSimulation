# Reds_ContactPhysicsSimulation

**Reds Assessment 2.5**

**Project instructions:**

Using the same batter prediction dataset, you will notice the `train.csv` contained `EXIT_SPEED`, `ANGLE`, and `DIRECTION` as columns but those were not available in the `test.csv`.

One way to utilize these data is to predict or recreate this information in some simulated way. Using the data available to you, please try and recreate the `EXIT_SPEED`, `ANGLE`, and `DIRECTION` information for each row in the `test.csv` dataset.
