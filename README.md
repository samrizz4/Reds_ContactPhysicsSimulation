Technical Assessment: 2.5

The attached folder, ```22-ds``` contains 20 files. Thirteen of those are visualizations (in .png format) that I created to further display the predicted values of Exit Velocity, Launch Angle, and Direction and help illustrate my findings. Three files are my R Script, my R Markdown file (same as R Script), and my knitted pdf file of the markdown, all titled ```RedsChallenge2.5```, with the appropriate extension. The pdf is accessible on the main page and also in the ```22-ds``` folder. Two files are the original ```train.csv``` and ```test.csv``` files that were provided. Along with those are two more csv's called ```myTrainDF.csv``` and ```myTest.csv``` - these contains all transformations that were performed and carried out on the original data sets. In ```myTrainDF.csv```, I carried out five different statistical/machine learning methods to calculate the predicted values of the three variables (Exit Velocity, Launch Angle, and Direction). The columns for these models are all labeled with the same structure: ```{variable}_{ModelType}```, with the implemented models being: Random Forest, SVM, logistic regression (GLM), GAM, and KNN. Each of the 5 models predicted the three variables, so there are 15 extra columns in ```myTrainDF.csv```. 

OPS and Handedness were also added into the model to factor in the on-base/slugging ability of the batter and matchup-specific at bats, respectively.

In ```myTestDF.csv``` are the original given columns, along with 9 extra total columns displaying the Exit Velocity, Launch Angle, and Direction for each of the GAM, GLM, and KNN models.

Note: At the bottom of my R script/Rmd, I added another possible solution using simulation to calculate the three variables, but not implemented due to time limit:

*Find the distribution of each of the 3 variables based on pitch type (say there are 4 pitch types) by classifying from KMeans. Then, using the batting/pitching info, repeatedly generate the outcome result ([From My Model in Assessment 2, Found Here](https://github.com/samrizz4/Reds_BatterPerformanceProjection)) of each plate appearance for each variable based on each pitch type and then randomly grab an exit velo, LA, and direction and pull the assigned outcome (out, 1b, 2b, 3b, hr) and randomly run 1000 times, compute the average, and assign that average to be the exit velo, LA, and direction, respectively, on test data.*
